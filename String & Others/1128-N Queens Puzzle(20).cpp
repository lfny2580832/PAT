Input Specification:

Each input file contains several test cases. The first line gives an integer K (1<K≤200). Then K lines follow, each gives a configuration in the format "N Q
​1
​​  Q
​2
​​  ... Q
​N
​​ ", where 4≤N≤1000 and it is guaranteed that 1≤Q
​i
​​ ≤N for all i=1,⋯,N. The numbers are separated by spaces.

Output Specification:

For each configuration, if it is a solution to the N queens problem, print YES in a line; or NO if not.
